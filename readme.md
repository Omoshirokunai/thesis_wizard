## Thesis wizard

### Problem

1. If given the option students and some researchers  will let the AI do all the work for them.
2. Teachers want to know whether students are just using AI do all the work in order to give a fair grade.
3. It is almost impossible to know if a student is using AI by just looking at the final product. the best you can do is get a probability of the student using AI. **This is not fair**

### Solution

Integrating Ai into the word processor and tracking AI usage to provide full disclosiure of Ai usage.
